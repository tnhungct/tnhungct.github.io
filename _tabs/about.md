I’m a **Data Analyst** driven by curiosity to uncover the meaning behind data and turn it into actionable insight.

My career began in finance, working at a local Vietnamese bank where I gained deep experience in credit risk, lending, and business analysis. Those years taught me how data reflects financial behavior and decision-making in the real world.

Later, I transitioned to the manufacturing and sales industry with Nichirei Suco Vietnam, managing sales of Acerola-based products. There, I discovered how data could explain market trends, customer behavior, and operational performance. Using simple data collection and analysis, I started building models to support sales strategies — that’s when I knew I wanted to pursue data analysis seriously.

Since then, I’ve focused on developing my skills in data visualization, data modeling, and analytical problem-solving. I enjoy learning through hands-on work, experimentation, and sharing what I discover — which is why I created this space to document and exchange ideas.
